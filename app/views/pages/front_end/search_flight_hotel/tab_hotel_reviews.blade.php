					I have to confess I was a bit sceptical before going to Courtyard as my previous experiences with big resorts are mixed (especially in Bali). But this is not a super big resort and we had a wonderful stay. First of all, very impressed by all the staff caring and ensuring everything is ok. Then, the hotel itself has been nicely set up. The pool area is big in a jungle style. The room and bathroom are big. Very good bedding, which is a very important point. Breakfast was very good with a good choice of cuisines. We used the restaurant as well for some food, it was good and not crazily overpriced. On the negative side, and I've read this in several comments, we can feel that the sound insulation is not good. Luckily we had quiet neighbours, but I understand why it could be a problem. Overall, very pleasant stay and I'll come back again.
